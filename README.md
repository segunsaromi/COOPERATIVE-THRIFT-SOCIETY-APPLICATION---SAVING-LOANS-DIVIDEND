# COOPERATIVE-THRIFT-SOCIETY-APPLICATION---SAVING-LOANS-DIVIDEND
This application is for cooperative and thrift society and it allows for registration, savings, loans and dividend sharing.

Firstly i will suggest you upload the sql file. Remove .sql extension and the remaining is the database name you can use to create the database after which you should upload the sql file in there. The database has some test data but you can creat yours while using the application.

Remember to update your databasese login details in the connect file. For this application i used root.

Secondly create a folder and name it whatever you want, only remeber that the name will constitute the url for accessing the application from your browser. Upload the two folders into the folder you created and thats all.

I have not created the module for add admin so i added admin login detail manually from the database and you can find it in coop_admin. The password i used is "asdfghjkl". 

The admin login i used to apporve membership, approve savings, approve loans, edit record from admin level, share dividend and lots more. you can play around the menus created and see the effect. for the brevity of time i will leave it here and later update this with more information.

The admin is required to go through prospective memebers application, loan application etc. to verify its correctness before doing any approval.

The users must first register. Since there will be no payment, i have added payment automatically for every registred applicants or prospective members.

After applying, they are required to take note of their application number displayed on the screen and phone number they used. This will be required to create a password in the sign-up link.

After they have successfully signed up they can now sign in into the portal to complete their information (profile, picture, bank details etc.)  and carry out several other task (loan application, guarantee approval etc.)

This application has lots more features and there are lots more feature i want to add to it but at the moment i am busy with other development.
